# 🏸 The Badminton Algorithm

**For Badminton Lovers — The New Era Is Here.**  
This project aims to revolutionize how we analyze and predict shuttle movements using real-world physics and AI.

## 🚀 About

Badminton is a fast-paced game where every millisecond and movement counts.  
**The Badminton Algorithm** is an AI-powered engine that can predict the shuttle's direction and landing point based on:

- 🌀 Wind speed & direction  
- 💨 Shuttle speed  
- 🖐️ Pressure/force applied during a shot  
- 🔄 Angle and spin (future feature)

## 🧠 Goal

To build a predictive algorithm that can:

- Accurately simulate shuttle trajectory  
- Help players analyze their shots  
- Improve training with AI-based feedback  
- Possibly integrate with sensors or camera vision in the future

## 🔧 Tech Stack (Planned)

- Python (Core Engine)  
- SciPy / NumPy (for physics modeling)  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (for ML predictions)  
- ESP32 / Arduino (for sensor integration - future)
- React / Next.js (for visual dashboard - optional)

## 📈 Future Features

- Real-time shuttle tracking with camera vision  
- Coach feedback system  
- 3D simulation of shuttle flight  
- Integration with wearable devices or rackets
